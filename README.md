# Article Recommendation Exploration

### Overview
Analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on IBM Watson Studio platform and compared various methods for a new article recommendation engine.

### Method 1: Rank Based Recommendations
Simply recommends the most popular articles based on the most interactions since there are no ratings for the articles on this platform.

### Method 2: User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
Determines similarity between users and then recommends new articles from similar users.

### Method 3: Singular Value Decomposition (Matrix Factorization)
Builds out a matrix decomposition based on user-article interactions for recommending articles.
